Given an array of first and last names, e.g. [“Alice Smith”, “Bob Evans”, “Roy Rogers”], how would you print out the full names line by line?
How would you print out only the first name?
How would you print out only the last name?
How could you print out only the initials?
How can you print out the last name and how many characters are in it?
How can you create an integer which represents the total number of characters in all the names?
