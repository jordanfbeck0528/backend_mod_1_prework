## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement uses if/then type logic. Often including else and elsif
conditions as well. These statements allow us to use boolean logic to determine outcomes.

If Jim goes, I will go.
If there are walnuts I can't eat it, otherwise let's eat!
I don't text you, my phone is not charged.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

An if-statement is especially useful for when you do not already know an
outcome, or many outcomes are possible. This way you can plan for many
alternate outcomes

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

'''

          variable = "value"

          if variable == value
            puts "something"
          end

'''
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

Using else and elsif allow for additional conditions for a statement.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

'''

              peanuts = 18

              if peanuts == 20
                p "huzzah!"
              elsif peanuts >= 21
                puts "That is a lot of peanuts!"
              else
                puts "I could use more peanuts!"
              end

'''

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to
use a conditional statement?

I have not yet seen other methods, but I presume using words like "when, while,
or during" could help modify If/Then statements.
