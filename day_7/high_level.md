a## Checker Board

Create a file called checker_board.rb and within that file, write a program that will print a checkerboard based on the size *indicated by the user*.  On this board, the black spaces will be represented with 'X' and the white spaces will be represented with ' '. An example of the output for a size 6 board would look like this:

```
X X X  
 X X X  
X X X  
 X X X  
X X X  
 X X X
 ```


 For the following problem I need to get a user's integer selection. Using that integer, I will need to  
 1.)  Create pattern of oscillating  "X", and then " " strings.  
 2.)  That pattern should be repeated, until the number of strings on that same line, are equal to the user's integer.  
 3.) If number of lines < the users integer, make a new line. Begin this new line by reversing the previous line's string pattern. Repeat step 2.)


Currently working with a mentor on this to get the coding part down!
